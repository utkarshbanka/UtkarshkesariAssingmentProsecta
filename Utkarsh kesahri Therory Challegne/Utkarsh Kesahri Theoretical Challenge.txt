Prospecta:
 Therory Question:

1) To  Tackle the challenge,I would parse the input csv data and convert each cell value in to either a number or a formula string, Then, I would evalutae the formulas using a reverse polish notataion alogritham or an equivalent method. finally, i would return the result as an output csv file with values replacing formulas where  applicable.

2) I would check for the follwing errors:
  Syntax error in the formulas(e.g mismatched parethis unsupported operator,etc)
 circular referecnes in the formulas 
 undefiend variablees in the foromulas
 divide by zero in the formulas;
 incorrect data types;

3) A user might break the code by: 
  *providing an incorrect format for the input csv data:
   *inculidng a large number of complex formulas that cause performance issues
Attempting to perform operations on a large number of cells,leading to memory constraits;
*introducing malicious formulas or variblaes in an attempt to exploit vulnerbiltes in the code;
